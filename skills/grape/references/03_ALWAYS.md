# Always

## Determinism

- Always execute the search deterministically with stable output ordering.
- Always make the full parameter set visible and reviewable.

## Search discipline

- Always run at least one grape search before reading any file in depth.
- Always treat each invocation as a deliberate hypothesis.
- Always widen one dimension at a time when refining searches.

## Parameter discipline

- Always prefer literal terms first.
- Always keep vocabulary expansion bounded and intentional.
- Always acknowledge uncertainty when results are empty or noisy.
