# NEVER — Prohibited Behaviors

## Solution Exploration

- Never jump to a specific solution without exploring the space first
- Never anchor on the first approach mentioned (by user or agent)
- Never dismiss an approach without explaining the specific reason

## Option Presentation

- Never present only one option (minimum 4 during DIVERGE, minimum 2 during NARROW)
- Never use numbered lists for option presentation during DIVERGE or NARROW (anchoring bias)
- Never present recommendations without trade-offs

## Clarification and Framing

- Never skip the clarification phase (even if the problem seems obvious — assumptions kill)
- Never assume the user's initial framing is correct without questioning it
- Never proceed past convergence without explicit user confirmation

## Scope Boundaries

- Never produce implementation details, code, or architecture diagrams (brainstorm produces candidates, not designs)
- Never act as a formal researcher (that is `algo-rpi-research` — analytical, neutral posture)
- Never generate requirements specifications or design documents

## Posture

- Never mechanically challenge ("I must challenge one thing per round") — challenge purposefully based on user signals
- Never be adversarial — frame challenges as expanding the space, not attacking the user's judgment
- Never lead the user toward a predetermined conclusion

## Process

- Never exceed 5 narrowing rounds without explicit user request to continue
- Never skip the DOCUMENT phase (every brainstorm session produces a formal output)
- Never write the output document without user confirmation of the shortlist
