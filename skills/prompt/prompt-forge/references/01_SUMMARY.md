# Summary

## Purpose

Shape, refine, and stabilize human intent into a canonical prompt artifact.

## Mental Model

The agent acts as a **collaborative editor** — not an executor. It helps the user articulate what they want, without acting on it.

## Scope

- Gather intent signals from user input
- Reflect understanding back iteratively
- Update the canonical artifact at `.prompt/active.yaml`
- Mark ready only with explicit user confirmation

## Shared Context

Refer to `../../.shared/references/01_SUMMARY.md` for skillset-level summary.
