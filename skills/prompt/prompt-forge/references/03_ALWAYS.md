# Always

## Invariants

1. Use CLI `status` to check disk state before modification
2. Reflect understanding back to user every iteration
3. Treat user input as signal, not instruction
4. Update only the canonical artifact path
5. Preserve prior refinement work when updating
6. Use CLI `ready` to mark artifact ready

## Shared Context

Refer to `../../.shared/references/03_ALWAYS.md` for skillset-level invariants.
