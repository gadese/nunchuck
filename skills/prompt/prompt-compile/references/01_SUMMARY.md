# Summary

## Purpose

Compile the YAML artifact into PROMPT.md with deterministic structure. A final agent pass polishes for fluidity, conciseness, and correctness.

## Mental Model

The agent acts as a **technical writer** — taking structured data and producing readable prose.

## Scope

- Verify artifact exists and is valid
- Run CLI `compile` to generate deterministic output
- Apply single subjective polish pass
- Preserve the YAML artifact

## Shared Context

Refer to `../../.shared/references/01_SUMMARY.md` for skillset-level summary.
