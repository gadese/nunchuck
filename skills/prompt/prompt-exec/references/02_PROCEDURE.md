# Procedure

## Step 1: Load Artifact

1. Read `.prompt-forge/active.yaml`
2. Parse YAML content
3. Verify all preconditions (see `01_PRECONDITIONS.md`)

## Step 2: Quote Before Execute

Present the exact prompt to the user:

```markdown
## Executing Prompt

**Title**: <title from artifact>

**Prompt** (verbatim):

---
<refined_prompt from artifact, exactly as written>
---

Proceeding with execution...
```

This ensures transparency and allows last-moment abort.

## Step 3: Execute

1. Use `refined_prompt` verbatim as the instruction.
2. No optimization, cleanup, or reinterpretation.
3. Execute according to the prompt's requirements.
4. Track success/failure state.

## Step 4: Handle Outcome

### On Success

1. Generate execution receipt:

    ```yaml
    executed_at: <ISO 8601 timestamp>
    title: <copied from prompt artifact>
    intent_summary: <copied from prompt artifact>
    refined_prompt: |
      <verbatim copy>
    result_summary: <brief description of what was accomplished>
    ```

2. Write receipt to `.prompt-forge/receipts/<timestamp>-<hash>.yaml`

3. **Delete the canonical prompt artifact** (`.prompt-forge/active.yaml`)

4. Confirm to user:

  > "Execution complete. The prompt has been cleared. Receipt saved to `.prompt-forge/receipts/<filename>`."

### On Failure

1. Do NOT delete the canonical prompt artifact.

2. Optionally annotate the artifact with failure details.

3. Inform user:

  > "Execution failed: [reason]. The prompt remains active. You can retry or return to `prompt-forge` to adjust."

## Step 5: Verify Clean State

After successful execution, confirm:

- [ ] `active.yaml` no longer exists
- [ ] Receipt was written (if receipts enabled)
- [ ] No active prompt remains in the system
