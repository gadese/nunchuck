# Preconditions

Before executing, verify:

1. `docs/planning/phase-<N>/plan.md` exists.
2. At least one sub-plan folder exists with `index.md` and task files
   (e.g., `a/index.md`, `a/i.md`).
3. Read the root plan and identify:
   - Plan title, objectives, constraints, success criteria
   - Sub-plan Index (letters + names)

If `<N>` is not specified by the user, choose the highest numbered `docs/planning/phase-*/` directory.
