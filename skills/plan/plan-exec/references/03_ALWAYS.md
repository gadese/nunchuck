# Always

- Always perform the Work steps as actual implementation (no “would do” outputs).
- Always verify results exist on disk before marking a task complete.
- Always write concrete **Output** and explicit **Handoff**.
- Always work in order (sub-plans a→b→c, tasks i→ii→iii) unless the user overrides.
