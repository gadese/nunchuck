# Always

- Always read references in the order declared by `00_ROUTER.md`.
- Always determine the next plan number deterministically (via CLI or filesystem), never guess.
- Always keep tasks bounded and written as checkable steps.
- Always leave `Output` and `Handoff` empty in task files (those are for `plan-exec`).
