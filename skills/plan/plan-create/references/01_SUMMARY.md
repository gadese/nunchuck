# Summary

Compiles the plan intent artifact `.plan/active.yaml` into a schema-validated active plan directory at `.plan/active/`.

The frontmatter for `plan.md`, each `index.md`, and each task file is **schema-validated**. The Markdown body is non-authoritative.

This skill is responsible for defining:

- Objective
- Success criteria
- Sub-plan structure
- Task Work steps

This skill is not responsible for executing the work (that is `plan-exec`).
