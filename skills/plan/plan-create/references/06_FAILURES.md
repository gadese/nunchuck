# Failures

## `uv` missing / CLI not runnable

- Stop and instruct the user to install `uv`.

## Intent missing or not ready

- Stop and run `plan-discuss` until `.plan/active.yaml` exists, is schema-valid, and is `status: ready`.

## Placeholder Work steps

- Stop and ask the user to provide concrete, checkable work steps.
