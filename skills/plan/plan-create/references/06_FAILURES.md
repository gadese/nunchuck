# Failures

## `uv` missing / CLI not runnable

- Stop and instruct the user to install `uv`.

## Could not determine next `<N>`

- Stop and run `../.shared/scripts/skill.sh list` / `../.shared/scripts/skill.sh next` to compute it deterministically.

## Placeholder Work steps

- Stop and ask the user to provide concrete, checkable work steps.
