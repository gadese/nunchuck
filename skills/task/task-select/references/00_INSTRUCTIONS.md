# Instructions

## Initialize

1. Read all reference files listed in `metadata.references` in order before taking action.

## Policies

### Always

1. Use the CLI script to select tasks — do not manually edit `.tasks/.active`.
2. Review any warnings printed after selection.
3. Consider warnings as prompts for skepticism, not blockers.

### Never

1. Never ignore warnings about stale or drifted tasks.
2. Never proceed with a stale task without explicit acknowledgment.
