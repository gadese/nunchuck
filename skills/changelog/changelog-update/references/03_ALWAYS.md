# Always

## Entry Quality

- Always write for humans, not machines
- Always include PR/issue reference when available
- Always use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Always be specific about what changed

## Duplicate Prevention

- Always check for existing entries first
- Always warn if duplicate detected
- Always skip silently if exact match exists
