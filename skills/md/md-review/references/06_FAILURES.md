# Failures

## Lint Not Run

1. Run lint first
2. Review lint output
3. Then proceed with subjective review

## No Issues Found

This is valid — document may be high quality.
Report "no critical issues" rather than inventing problems.

## Disagreement with User

If user disagrees with subjective assessment:
1. Acknowledge their perspective
2. Explain reasoning for suggestion
3. Defer to user on style choices
