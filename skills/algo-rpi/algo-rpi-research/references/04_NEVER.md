# Never

## Prohibitions

**YOU MUST NOT:**

- **Implement or refactor code** — This is a research phase only; no code changes allowed

- **Decide a final implementation approach without user confirmation** — Present options and trade-offs, but let the user choose the final approach

- **Critique unrelated parts of the system** — Stay focused on the algorithmic scope; don't analyze unrelated code quality issues

- **Include code blocks from files** — Use file path references with line ranges only; never copy code into the research document

- **Skip clarification when ambiguous** — If the problem statement, constraints, or data characteristics are unclear, you MUST ask clarifying questions before proceeding

- **Echo contents of secrets or config files** — Reference their presence and paths only

- **Use external permalinks** — Only use local file paths for references; no external links (you may cite papers by name only if needed)

- **Read large data dumps and archives** — Ignore/skip `**/data/**`, `**/images/**`, `**/assets/**`, `**/archives/**`, `**/results/**`, `**/outputs/**` unless explicitly requested

- **Proceed directly when scope is broad** — If the request is ambiguous or underspecified, apply the clarification protocol first
