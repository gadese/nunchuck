# Algo-RPI Pipelines

Available pipelines for the `algo-rpi` skillset.

## Available Pipelines

### 00_DEFAULT.md — Full Algo-RPI Workflow
Complete Algorithm Research-Plan-Implement cycle with code review and commit message generation.
- Algorithm Research → Algorithm Plan → Algorithm Implement → Code Review → Commit Message
- Includes mandatory pause points between phases
- P0-P5 phased implementation with performance gates
- Quantitative verification and reproducibility enforcement

### 01_RESEARCH_ONLY.md — Algorithm Research Phase Only
Execute only the algorithm research phase to formalize problem and explore solutions.
- Produces research document in `llm_docs/research/`
- Useful for problem exploration before committing to implementation

### 02_PLAN_ONLY.md — Algorithm Plan Phase Only
Execute only the algorithm planning phase based on existing research.
- Requires research document path as input
- Produces implementation plan in `llm_docs/plans/`

### 03_IMPLEMENT_ONLY.md — Algorithm Implement Phase Only
Execute only the algorithm implementation phase based on existing plan.
- Requires plan document path as input
- Includes P0-P5 phases with quantitative verification

### 04_FULL_WORKFLOW.md — Full Algo-RPI Workflow with AI Expert Review
Complete Algorithm Research-Plan-Implement cycle with AI expert review and reimagine phases.
- Algorithm Research → Algorithm Plan → AI Expert Plan Review → AI Expert Plan Reimagine → Algorithm Implement → Code Review → Commit Message
- Includes AI/ML expert review for theoretical soundness, numerical stability, and production-readiness
- Includes AI/ML expert reimagination for optimized algorithm design
- Mandatory pause points between phases with user approval
- P0-P5 phased implementation with performance gates
- Quantitative verification and reproducibility enforcement
