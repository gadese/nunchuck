# Router — Commit Message Skill

## Default Route

Read all references in order: 01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06

## No Special Routing

This skill has a straightforward, linear process:
1. Analyze staged changes
2. Determine commit type
3. Generate commit message
4. Present to user for confirmation
5. Execute commit (if user approves)

No conditional routing needed.
