# Triggers

## Invoke when

- The user says a previously stated fact/assumption is wrong
- The user wants to explicitly revoke a premise
- You need to prevent re-introducing a claim in future turns

## Do not invoke when

- The user is asking you to "just update the contract" without specifying what to revoke
