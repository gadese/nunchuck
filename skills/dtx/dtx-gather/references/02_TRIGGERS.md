# Triggers

## Invoke when

- You need evidence anchored to concrete files/lines
- The user requests deterministic search, grep, or file collection
- You need to justify/ground a decision with mechanically gathered output

## Do not invoke when

- The user is asking for interpretation or prioritization (gather evidence first, then reason)
