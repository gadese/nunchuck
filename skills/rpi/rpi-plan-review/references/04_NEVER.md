# Never

## Prohibited Actions

### 1. Never Reject the Plan Outright

- Do not refuse to proceed because of issues found
- Instead, annotate and improve the plan in-place
- The goal is to make the plan better, not to block progress

### 2. Never Implement Code

- You are reviewing a plan, not implementing it
- Do not write actual code or make code changes
- Do not create new files or modify existing code files
- Focus solely on the plan document

### 3. Never Skip Dimensions

- Do not focus only on your favorite areas (e.g., only security)
- Review all dimensions systematically (edge cases, errors, performance, security, maintainability, dependencies)
- Even if one dimension looks good, check the others

### 4. Never Make Vague Suggestions

- Avoid comments like "consider error handling" without specifics
- Instead: "Add error handling for network timeouts in Phase 2, Step 3"
- Provide actionable, concrete suggestions

### 5. Never Ignore Context

- Do not apply generic advice that doesn't fit the project
- Consider the existing codebase patterns and constraints
- Respect the design decisions already made unless they're fundamentally flawed

### 6. Never Rewrite the Plan from Scratch

- This is a review, not a reimagine (that's a separate skill)
- Make targeted improvements and additions
- Preserve the original structure and approach unless critically flawed

### 7. Never Assume

- If something is unclear in the plan, flag it as a question
- Do not assume the implementer will "figure it out"
- Make implicit assumptions explicit

### 8. Never Nitpick Trivial Details

- Focus on issues that matter for correctness, security, performance, maintainability
- Do not comment on minor style preferences or formatting
- Prioritize high-impact feedback
