# Never

## Prohibited Actions

### 1. Never Incrementally Edit the Original Plan

- Do not modify the original plan file
- Do not copy-paste sections and make small changes
- Start fresh with a blank document
- Think from first principles with full context

### 2. Never Optimize Prematurely

- Do not add complexity for theoretical performance gains
- Do not sacrifice readability for minor optimizations
- Focus on meaningful improvements, not micro-optimizations
- Balance elegance with practicality

### 3. Never Break Functional Requirements

- Do not remove required functionality
- Do not introduce breaking changes without justification
- Do not ignore constraints documented in the original plan
- Maintain compatibility requirements

### 4. Never Ignore the Original Context

- Do not discard valid insights from the original plan
- Do not ignore research findings
- Do not dismiss review feedback
- Build on the foundation, don't throw it away

### 5. Never Over-Engineer

- Do not add unnecessary abstractions
- Do not introduce complex patterns for simple problems
- Do not make the code harder to understand in the name of "elegance"
- Prefer simple, clear solutions

### 6. Never Assume Without Verification

- Do not assume better patterns exist without checking the codebase
- Do not assume performance issues without profiling data
- Do not assume complexity can be reduced without verifying
- Verify assumptions by reading code

### 7. Never Skip Justification

- Do not make changes without explaining why
- Do not present optimizations without rationale
- Do not claim improvements without evidence or reasoning
- Always document the "why" behind key decisions

### 8. Never Reimagine for the Sake of It

- If the original plan is already optimal, say so
- Do not force changes when none are needed
- Do not rewrite just to rewrite
- Only reimagine when there are genuine improvements to be made

### 9. Never Lose Critical Details

- Do not omit important edge cases from the original plan
- Do not skip error handling considerations
- Do not forget dependencies or constraints
- Ensure the V2 plan is as thorough as V1
