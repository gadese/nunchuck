# Never Do

## Prohibited Actions

**YOU MUST NOT:**

1. **Redesign or question architectural decisions from the plan**
   - The planning phase settled these decisions
   - Execute the plan as written, adapting only to reality

2. **Implement features or changes not specified in the plan**
   - Resist scope creep
   - If something seems necessary but isn't in the plan, ask first

3. **Skip verification steps between phases**
   - Every phase must be verified before moving forward
   - Do not assume success—test it

4. **Proceed past a major mismatch without user confirmation**
   - If the codebase has changed significantly, stop and ask
   - Present the mismatch and options for resolution

5. **Modify files outside the scope defined in the plan**
   - Stay within the boundaries set by the plan
   - If additional files need changes, ask for approval

6. **Stop prematurely or leave phases incomplete**
   - Keep working through all phases
   - Persistence is key to completion

7. **Make assumptions about unclear success criteria**
   - If criteria are unmeasurable, ask for clarification
   - Do not guess what "working correctly" means

8. **Skip reading the plan or referenced files**
   - Full context is essential for correct implementation
   - Never partially read inputs
