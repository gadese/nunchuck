# Purpose

The `doctor-exam` skill conducts focused, evidence-driven examination of a single suspect area.

## Why Exam Matters

Triage surfaces hypotheses. Exam **tests** them.

A hypothesis is not proven by being plausible — it is tested by seeking evidence that could confirm or falsify it.

## What Exam Does

1. **Focuses** on one suspect zone (from triage)
2. **Gathers** both confirming and disconfirming evidence
3. **Updates** confidence based on findings
4. **Surfaces** new discoveries for potential re-triage

## What Exam Does NOT Do

- Examine multiple zones (that's multiple exams, or re-triage)
- Fix issues (that's implementation)
- Propose treatments (that's `doctor-treatment`)

## The Exam Mindset

Think of exam as a **scientific test**:

- You have a hypothesis (from triage)
- You design observations that would confirm or falsify it
- You gather those observations
- You update your belief based on what you find

A good exam can result in:

- **Confirmed** — evidence strongly supports hypothesis
- **Weakened** — evidence casts doubt on hypothesis
- **Falsified** — evidence contradicts hypothesis
- **Inconclusive** — more evidence needed

All of these are valid outcomes. The goal is **truth**, not confirmation.

## Success Criteria

A successful exam note:

- Is bounded to ONE suspect area
- Contains both confirming and disconfirming evidence
- Updates confidence with rationale
- States what would falsify the hypothesis
- Is consumable by another agent with no prior context
