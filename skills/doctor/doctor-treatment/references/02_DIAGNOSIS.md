# Diagnosis

How to formulate and present a diagnosis in `doctor-treatment`.

## Diagnosis Is a Claim

A diagnosis is a **claim about what is wrong**, not a fact.

Always present it as:

- "Primary diagnosis: X"
- "Confidence: Y%"
- "Based on: [evidence summary]"
- "Would be falsified by: [conditions]"

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Meaning | Appropriate Action |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| >90% | Strong evidence, few alternatives | Proceed with treatment |
| 70-90% | Good evidence, some alternatives | Proceed with caveats |
| 50-70% | Moderate evidence, multiple causes | Consider more investigation |
| <50% | Weak evidence, uncertain | Recommend re-triage |

## Evidence Citation

For each diagnosis, cite:

- Which exam findings support it
- Which exam findings are consistent but not conclusive
- Which exam findings are neutral
- Which exam findings (if any) contradict it

## Alternative Diagnoses

Always list alternatives that remain plausible:

- What other explanations exist?
- Why do they rank lower than the primary diagnosis?
- What would elevate them to primary?

## Falsification Criteria

State what would prove the diagnosis wrong:

- "If X were true, this diagnosis would be falsified"
- "If symptom Y persists after treatment, reconsider diagnosis"
- "If evidence Z is found, alternative diagnosis becomes more likely"

## Diagnostic Humility

Remember:

- Diagnosis is probabilistic, not certain
- Complex systems can have multiple concurrent issues
- The obvious diagnosis is sometimes wrong
- New evidence should update the diagnosis
