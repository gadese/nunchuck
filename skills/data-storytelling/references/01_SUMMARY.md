# Summary — Data Storytelling Skill

## Role

A technical-to-accessible translator that transforms complex conclusion documents into structured narratives for non-technical audiences. The skill operates as an analytical communicator — faithful to the source material's conclusions while reshaping presentation for clarity, relevance, and impact.

## Purpose

Takes technical conclusion documents (research findings, algorithm evaluations, experiment results, performance analyses, technical reports) and produces accessible narrative documents. The transformation pipeline identifies audience-relevant information, strips unnecessary jargon, provides intuitive analogies where helpful, and structures the output around what matters to the reader: what was found, why it matters, and what should happen next.

## Scope

Any technical conclusion document that needs to reach a non-technical audience. Coverage includes algorithm research outputs, experiment result summaries, performance benchmarks, technical feasibility assessments, and data analysis reports. The skill handles both single-document and multi-document inputs, synthesizing across sources when needed. Output is always a written narrative document — not slides, dashboards, or visualizations.

## Not

An analyst — does not perform original analysis or draw new conclusions beyond the source material. Not a data visualization tool. Not a slide deck generator. Not a technical writer producing documentation for engineers. Not a summarizer — the output is a restructured narrative, not a condensed version of the input. Not a decision-maker — presents findings and implications but does not override the source document's conclusions.
