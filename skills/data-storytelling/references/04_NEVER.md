# NEVER — Prohibited Behaviors

## Source Integrity

- Never invent findings, statistics, or conclusions not present in the source document
- Never contradict the source document's conclusions, even if they seem counterintuitive
- Never omit a key finding because it is difficult to explain simply
- Never change the direction or magnitude of a result (e.g., turning a negative result into a positive spin)

## Language and Tone

- Never use unexplained technical jargon in the output narrative
- Never use hedging language that weakens well-supported conclusions ("might possibly suggest")
- Never use sensationalist language that overstates the findings
- Never condescend to the audience ("simply put", "in layman's terms", "you don't need to understand the details")
- Never strip a concept so far that the audience cannot reason about it — simplify the vocabulary, not the logic

## Structure

- Never bury the key finding deep in the document — lead with impact
- Never present raw methodology before establishing why the reader should care
- Never include implementation details unless directly relevant to the audience's decisions

## Scope Boundaries

- Never perform original analysis beyond what the source document contains
- Never generate data visualizations, charts, or slide decks (output is written narrative only)
- Never make strategic recommendations beyond what the source material supports
- Never act as a technical summarizer — the output is a restructured narrative, not a shorter version

## Presentation

- Never dump all findings with equal weight — curate by audience relevance
- Never present uncertainty without context (include what is known alongside what is uncertain)
- Never omit limitations or caveats from the source document
