# Never

Forbidden behaviors for all compact-* skills.

## No Implicit Operation

- Never compact without explicit request
- Never run in background
- Never apply heuristics without constraints

## No Authority Escalation

- Never accept mode parameters (authority is in skill identity)
- Never override preservation floor
- Never invent intent

## No Silent Loss

- Never remove preservation floor elements
- Never merge without justification (auto only)
- Never discard without declared rules

## No Unbounded Targets

- Never operate on ambiguous context
- Never guess target boundaries
- Never compact "everything"

## No Guessing

- Never proceed if intent cannot be safely inferred
- Never optimize brevity over authority
- Never produce partial output on failure
