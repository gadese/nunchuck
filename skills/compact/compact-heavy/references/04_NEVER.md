# Never

## Preservation Floor Still Applies

Even in heavy mode, never remove:

- Explicit decisions
- Active constraints
- Open questions (TODOs)
- Normative language

## No Guessing

- Never remove if decision status is unclear
- Never merge entities without semantic equivalence
- Never normalize language if meaning changes
