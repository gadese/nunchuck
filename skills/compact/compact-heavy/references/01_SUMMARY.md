# Summary

**compact-heavy** performs doctrine-style compaction.

## Mental Model

Heavy compaction produces **doctrine** — canonical, decision-oriented context that carries forward only what is needed for action.

## Optimization Bias

**Authority > recoverability**

Final decisions matter. The path to them does not.

## Authority Level

Heavy compaction has **high epistemic authority**. It may remove rationale once decisions exist, remove abandoned alternatives, and normalize language.
