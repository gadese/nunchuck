# Always

## Must Preserve

- Final decisions
- Active constraints
- Current intent
- Operational facts
- Named entities
- Normative language

## Allowed Actions

- Remove rationale once decisions exist
- Remove abandoned alternatives
- Remove exploration that led nowhere
- Normalize language for clarity
- Merge near-equivalent concepts
- Collapse verbose phrasing

## Default Loss Bias

**Discard** — if clearly redundant or superseded, remove.
