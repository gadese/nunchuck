# Summary

**compact-light** performs checkpoint-style compaction.

## Mental Model

Light compaction is a **checkpoint** — reducing redundancy while preserving the ability to reconstruct reasoning.

## Optimization Bias

**Recoverability > brevity**

When in doubt, keep.

## Authority Level

Light compaction has the **lowest epistemic authority**. It cannot remove rationale, merge concepts, or normalize language aggressively.
