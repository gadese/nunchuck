# Execution Rules (non-negotiable)

- Only modify `docs/planning/phase-<N>/<active-letter>/<active-roman>.md` while
  executing work. Exceptions: scaffolding missing sub-plans/tasks per Procedure,
  and root plan updates during wrap-up.
- Do NOT rewrite previous task files once completed.
- Each task file must end with:
  - a concrete **Output** (what changed, what was decided, what was produced)
  - an explicit **Handoff** to the next task (or next sub-plan after the last task)
- If scope expands:
  - create a new sub-plan folder with `index.md` and task files listed in it
  - update the root Sub-plan Index by appending the new entry
  - do NOT alter earlier task files
