# Execution Rules (non-negotiable)

- Only modify `docs/planning/phase-<N>/<active-letter>/<active-roman>.md` while executing work.
- Do NOT rewrite previous roman files once completed.
- Each roman file must end with:
  - a concrete **Output** (what changed, what was decided, what was produced)
  - an explicit **Handoff** to the next roman file (or next letter after `iv`)
- If scope expands:
  - create a new subphase letter folder + roman files (`i.md`–`iv.md`)
  - update the root Subphase Index by appending the new entry
  - do NOT alter earlier roman files
