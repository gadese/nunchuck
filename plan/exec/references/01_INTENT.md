# Intent

Execute an existing plan in `docs/planning/phase-<N>/` by completing sub-plans
in alphabetical order (a, b, c, ...), using roman numeral task files within each
sub-plan, producing tangible outputs and preserving rationale.

The skill walks through each sub-plan sequentially, updating only the active
task file, appending outputs and handoffs, and finishing by checking off
success criteria in the root `plan.md`.
