# Intent

Execute an existing planning phase in `docs/planning/phase-<N>/` by completing subphases in alphabetical order (a, b, c, ...), using roman numeral files (`i.md`–`iv.md`) within each letter, producing tangible outputs and preserving rationale.

The skill walks through each lettered subphase sequentially, updating only the active roman file, appending outputs and handoffs, and finishing by checking off success criteria in the root `plan.md`.
