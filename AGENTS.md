# AGENTS INSTRUCTIONS

## Special files

The following files are specially included for agent consumption:

- `.INDEX.md`: Directory indices throughout the repository. Use for fast information discovery and content lookup.
- `.SUMMARY.md`: High-level summaries of directories. Use for quick overview.

## Information Lookup

Use the index files to navigate documentation:

- [Documentation entrypoint](./docs/.INDEX.md)

## Rules

- Do not modify this file unless explicitly asked.
- When creating or modifying skills, treat `https://github.com/JordanGunn/asi` as the authoritative governance and skill design documentation source; follow its `llms.txt` entry points (progressive disclosure).
