# Skills

- `changelog` - Manages Keep a Changelog format files with deterministic operations, chrono-aware guardrails, and git integration.
- `changelog-init` - Initialize a Keep a Changelog format file from template.
- `changelog-release` - Cut a release by transforming [Unreleased] into versioned section.
- `changelog-update` - Add entries to [Unreleased] section with duplicate detection.
- `changelog-verify` - Verify changelog format compliance and structural integrity.
- `doctor` - Diagnoses software failures by combining deterministic evidence gathering with agent judgment. Models failures as medical cases. Idempotent — run repeatedly until confident diagnosis, then generate schema-based treatment.
- `dtx` - Orchestrator skill for the `dtx` skillset. Manages an agent's working context via explicit, auditable `.dtx/` artifacts.
- `dtx-forget` - Revoke a premise by appending to `.dtx/FORGET.yml`, and update `.dtx/CONTRACT.yml` where safe.
- `dtx-gather` - Deterministic evidence gathering (glob + ripgrep) recorded as `.dtx/EXPANDS/<EXP-ID>/`.
- `dtx-state` - Present the current admissible working set from `.dtx/CONTRACT.yml`, alongside revoked premises from `.dtx/FORGET.yml`.
- `dtx-validate` - Validate `.dtx/` disk-context artifacts for parseability, integrity, and staleness. Read-only.
- `grape` - AI-enabled, deterministic codebase search. Converts vague intent into explicit, auditable grep parameters and executes a stable surface scan over disk.
- `md` - Orchestrates markdown document workflows with deterministic operations (split, merge, lint) and agent review.
- `md-merge` - Merges markdown chunks back into a single document, reversing the split operation with integrity checks.
- `md-review` - Agent review for markdown quality, clarity, and structural integrity. Leverages deterministic lint output as input for subjective assessment.
- `md-split` - Splits a Markdown file by H2 headings into numbered documents and generates an index file.
- `plan` - Orchestrator skill for the `plan` skillset. Manages bounded work units with structured plans stored in `.plan/`.
- `plan-create` - Scaffold and populate a new plan in `.plan/<N>/` with root plan, sub-plans, and task files.
- `plan-exec` - Execute plan tasks by performing actual work. Writes concrete Output and Handoff for each task. Execution means implementation.
- `plan-review` - Final agent review pass on a completed plan. Verifies success criteria, checks for gaps, and produces a summary assessment.
- `plan-status` - Display plan progress by parsing frontmatter metadata. Shows status at-a-glance via CLI.
- `prompt` - Orchestrator skill for the `prompt` skillset. Separates intent formation from execution to protect humans from premature or misaligned action.
- `prompt-compile` - Compile the YAML artifact into PROMPT.md with deterministic structure. A final agent pass polishes for fluidity, conciseness, and correctness.
- `prompt-exec` - Execute the forged prompt exactly as written. Requires explicit consent and a ready artifact. Deletes artifact after successful execution.
- `prompt-forge` - Shape, refine, and stabilize human intent into a canonical prompt artifact. Iteratively clarifies ambiguity until user confirms readiness.
- `task` - Orchestrator skill for the `task` skillset. Manages bounded work units with single-file tasks stored in `.tasks/`, skepticism-aware hashing, and staleness detection.
- `task-close` - Close a task by setting state to closed, recording close_reason and closed_at. Recomputes intent hash and clears `.tasks/.active` if it pointed to this task.
- `task-create` - Create a new task file in `.tasks/<id>.md` from template. Sets timestamps, computes initial intent hash, and optionally auto-selects the task.
- `task-list` - List tasks in `.tasks/` with derived flags (stale, hash mismatch). Supports filtering by state and staleness. Stable ordering by updated_at.
- `task-select` - Select a task by writing its ID to `.tasks/.active`. Prints the selected task path and any suspicion flags (stale, hash mismatch) to encourage skepticism.
