# Skills
- `algo-rpi` - Orchestrator skill for the `algo-rpi` skillset. Manages the Algorithm Research-Plan-Implement workflow for algorithm development and optimization tasks.
- `algo-rpi-implement` - Algorithm implementation execution for the Algo-RPI workflow. Executes approved plans with quantitative verification and reproducibility.
- `algo-rpi-plan` - Algorithm implementation planning for the Algo-RPI workflow. Creates detailed, quantitative implementation plans with P0-P5 phases.
- `algo-rpi-research` - Algorithm problem research and solution space exploration for the Algo-RPI workflow. Produces formal problem understanding and comparative analysis of candidate algorithms.
- `code-review` - Systematic code review and cleanup skill. Reviews ONLY modified or specified files for quality, adherence to guidelines, and best practices. Can be invoked standalone or as part of R-P-I workflows.
- `coding-standards` - Centralized code principles and style guidelines. Referenced by rpi, algo-rpi, code-review, and doctor skillsets. Not invoked directly.
- `commit-message` - Generate descriptive, conventional commit messages based on code changes. Analyzes staged changes and produces clear, informative commit messages.
- `doctor` - Diagnoses software failures by combining deterministic evidence gathering with agent judgment. Models failures as medical cases. Idempotent — run repeatedly until confident diagnosis, then generate schema-based treatment.
- `memory-bank` - Manages workspace-specific Memory Bank files in `llm_docs/memory/`. Provides persistent cross-session context for AI agents. Global skill usable across multiple workspaces and projects.
- `rpi` - Orchestrator skill for the `rpi` skillset. Manages the Research-Plan-Implement workflow for general software development tasks.
- `rpi-implement` - Plan execution for the Research-Plan-Implement workflow. Translates approved technical plans into working, tested code.
- `rpi-plan` - Technical planning for the Research-Plan-Implement workflow. Produces actionable implementation plans based on research documents.
- `rpi-research` - Descriptive codebase research for the Research-Plan-Implement workflow. Produces technical documentation about current system state.
