# algo-rpi-full

This workflow uses the full Algo-RPI pipeline with AI expert review phases.

## Pipeline

- **Path:** `skills/algo-rpi/.pipelines/04_FULL_WORKFLOW.md`

## Workflow Phases

1. **Algorithm Research** — Formalize problem and explore candidate solutions
2. **Algorithm Plan** — Create detailed implementation plan with P0-P5 phases
3. **AI Expert Plan Review** — Review for theoretical soundness, numerical stability, production-readiness
4. **AI Expert Plan Reimagine** — Reimagine plan from scratch for optimal algorithm design
5. **Algorithm Implement** — Execute approved plan with quantitative verification
6. **Code Review** — Review implementation for quality and best practices
7. **Commit Message** — Generate conventional commit message

## When to Use

Use this workflow when:
- Algorithm choice is critical and needs expert validation
- Performance targets are aggressive and need optimization
- Production deployment requires high confidence in design
- You want a second opinion on the algorithm approach

For standard workflow without expert review, use `/algo-rpi` instead.
