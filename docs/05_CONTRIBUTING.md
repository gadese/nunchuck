## Before You Start

### Review Existing Skills

Before creating a new skill:
1. Check the [Skills Reference](./02_SKILLS.md) to avoid duplication
2. Review similar skills to understand patterns and conventions
3. Read the [Schema Documentation](./04_SCHEMAS.md) to understand structure

### Understand the Philosophy

Skills in this repository are designed to:
- **Prevent common issues** in agentic programming sessions
- **Provide clear guidance** with structured instructions
- **Enable progressive disclosure** through reference files
- **Support automation** through executable scripts
- **Maintain independence** while allowing composition

---

## Adding Individual Skills

### Step 1: Choose a Category

Organize your skill into an appropriate category directory:
- `adapter/` - IDE and tool integrations
- `index/` - Discovery and cataloging
- `plan/` - Planning and execution
- `refactor/` - Code quality and improvements
- Or create a new category if needed

### Step 2: Create Directory Structure

```bash
category/
└── your-skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md              # Required: Frontmatter only
    ├── references/           # Required: Detailed documentation
    │   ├── 00_INSTRUCTIONS.md
    │   ├── 01_INTENT.md
    │   └── 02_PROCEDURE.md
    └── scripts/              # Optional: Executable scripts
        ├── script.sh         # Unix/macOS/Linux
        └── script.ps1        # Windows PowerShell
```

### Step 3: Create SKILL.md

**Important:** `SKILL.md` must contain **only frontmatter** - no Markdown body content.

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
license: MIT
description: >
  Clear description of what this skill does and when to use it.
  Include specific keywords that help agents identify relevant tasks.
metadata:
  author: Your Name or Organization
  version: 0.1.0
  references:
    - 00_INSTRUCTIONS.md
    - 01_INTENT.md
    - 02_PROCEDURE.md
  scripts:
    - script.sh
    - script.ps1
  keywords:
    - keyword1
    - keyword2
    - keyword3
---
```

#### Required Fields

- **`name`**: Lowercase with hyphens only, must match directory name
- **`description`**: 1-1024 characters, describes purpose and usage triggers

#### Recommended Metadata

- **`author`**: Your name or organization
- **`version`**: Semantic version (start with `0.1.0`)
- **`references`**: List all reference files in order
- **`scripts`**: List all script files (both `.sh` and `.ps1`)
- **`keywords`**: Improve discoverability (5-10 keywords recommended)

### Step 4: Write Reference Files

Create focused documentation in the `references/` directory:

#### Naming Convention
- Format: `NN_TOPIC.md`
- `NN`: Zero-padded number (00, 01, 02, ...)
- `TOPIC`: Uppercase with underscores (e.g., `INTENT`, `PROCEDURE`)

#### Recommended Structure
1. **00_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Quick overview and signals
2. **01_INTENT.md** - Purpose and goals
3. **02_PRECONDITIONS.md** - Requirements and setup
4. **03_PROCEDURE.md** - Step-by-step instructions
5. **04_OUTPUT.md** - Expected results

Add more as needed, but keep each file focused on one topic.

### Step 5: Add Scripts (Optional)

If your skill includes automation:

#### Cross-Platform Support
Provide both Unix and Windows versions:
- `script-name.sh` for macOS/Linux/WSL
- `script-name.ps1` for Windows PowerShell

#### Script Requirements
- **Self-contained**: Document all dependencies
- **Error handling**: Provide helpful error messages
- **Exit codes**: Use 0 for success, non-zero for errors
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic
- **Permissions**: Make `.sh` files executable

#### Example Script Header

**Bash:**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Description: Brief description of what this script does
# Requirements: git, jq
# Usage: ./script-name.sh [args]

set -euo pipefail
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Description: Brief description of what this script does
# Requirements: git, PowerShell 5.1+
# Usage: .\script-name.ps1 [args]

$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
```

### Step 6: Update Documentation

1. **Add to README** - Include your skill in the appropriate section
2. **Regenerate INDEX** - Run `./index/scripts/index.sh` or `.\index\scripts\index.ps1`
3. **Update Skills Reference** - Add entry to `docs/02_SKILLS.md`

## Adding Skillsets

### When to Create a Skillset

Create a skillset when:
- You have **multiple related skills** that work together
- Skills follow a **recommended execution order**
- Skills **share common resources** or terminology
- You want to **signal grouping** to agents and users

### Step 1: Create Member Skills

First, create all member skills following the [Individual Skills](#adding-individual-skills) guidelines. Each member must be a complete, independent skill.

### Step 2: Create Skillset Directory

```bash
category/
├── SKILL.md                   # Skillset orchestrator
├── .resources/                # Shared resources (optional)
│   └── references/
│       ├── TAXONOMY.md
│       └── TEMPLATES.md
├── member-one/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── member-two/
    └── SKILL.md
```

### Step 3: Create Skillset SKILL.md

Add the `metadata.skillset` field with the strict schema:

```yaml
---
name: your-skillset-name
description: >
  Orchestrator skill for the `your-skillset-name` skillset. 
  Dispatches to member skills for [purpose].
metadata:
  author: Your Name
  version: 0.1.0

  # Strict structure (convention). Agents/tools may parse this.
  skillset:
    name: your-skillset-name
    schema_version: 1
    skills:
      - member-skill-one
      - member-skill-two
      - member-skill-three

    # Shared resources directory (optional)
    resources:
      root: .resources
      assets: []
      scripts: []
      references: 
        - TAXONOMY.md
        - TEMPLATES.md

    # Execution pipelines
    pipelines:
      default:
        - member-skill-one
        - member-skill-two
        - member-skill-three
      allowed:
        - [member-skill-one]
        - [member-skill-two]
        - [member-skill-three]
        - [member-skill-one, member-skill-two]
        - [member-skill-one, member-skill-two, member-skill-three]

    requires: []
---
```

### Step 4: Define Pipelines

#### Default Pipeline
The recommended execution order for all member skills:
```yaml
default:
  - skill-one
  - skill-two
  - skill-three
```

#### Allowed Combinations
All valid skill execution sequences:
```yaml
allowed:
  - [skill-one]                          # Individual skills
  - [skill-two]
  - [skill-three]
  - [skill-one, skill-two]               # Partial sequences
  - [skill-one, skill-three]
  - [skill-one, skill-two, skill-three]  # Full sequence
```

**Guidelines:**
- Include the default pipeline in allowed
- Add individual skills if they can run standalone
- Document any dependencies in comments
- Consider common use cases

### Step 5: Add Shared Resources (Optional)

If member skills share common resources:

1. Create `.resources/` directory
2. Add shared reference files, assets, or scripts
3. List them in `metadata.skillset.resources`
4. Reference them from member skills as needed

**Example shared resource:**
```
.resources/
└── references/
    ├── TAXONOMY.md       # Shared terminology
    └── OUTPUT_FORMAT.md  # Standard report format
```

### Step 6: Update Documentation

1. **Add to README** - Include skillset in appropriate section
2. **Regenerate INDEX** - Run index script
3. **Add to Skillsets docs** - Update `docs/03_SKILLSETS.md`
4. **Document orchestration** - Explain how skills work together

### Code Style

- **Follow platform conventions** - Bash for `.sh`, PowerShell for `.ps1`
- **Use consistent indentation** - 2 or 4 spaces (be consistent)
- **Add error handling** - Check preconditions and fail gracefully
- **Write helpful messages** - Users should understand what went wrong

### Documentation Style

- **Use headers** - Organize content with clear sections
- **Include code blocks** - Show examples with syntax highlighting
