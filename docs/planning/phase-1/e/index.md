# Phase 1e — Quality gates and cleanup

## Brief

Make deterministic validation and correctness checks a first-class concept, and ensure the repo is clean and consistent after the re-org.

## Tasks

* i — Validation gate — Add a deterministic validation script and wire it into repo workflows
* ii — Idempotence checks — Ensure install/uninstall and indexing are safe to rerun
* iii — Final sweep — Fix drift, update plan success criteria, and produce a wrap-up summary
