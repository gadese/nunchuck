# Phase 1a — Target package layout and validation rules

## Brief

Define the canonical on-disk layout for skill packages and the validation rules that `nunchuck` will enforce, based on the Agent Skills spec and this repo’s conventions.

## Tasks

* i — Inventory current structure — Identify what must be preserved vs changed for packaging
* ii — Define target layout — Specify canonical directories, naming, and resource boundaries
* iii — Define validation rules — Decide what `nunchuck validate` checks and how it reports
