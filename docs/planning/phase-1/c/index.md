# Phase 1c — Migrate/refactor existing skills to the new layout

## Brief

Refactor/migrate existing skills and skillsets into the canonical `nunchuck` package structure while keeping each skill independently usable and spec-compliant.

## Tasks

* i — Compliance audit — Identify and fix spec/convention mismatches across all skills
* ii — Resource boundaries — Normalize `.resources/`, `assets/`, `references/`, `scripts/` boundaries
* iii — Regenerate indexes/adapters — Ensure discovery and workflows match the new structure
