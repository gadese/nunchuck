# Shared Resources

A skillset MAY include a `.shared/` sibling directory for resources shared across member skills.

`.shared/` is a permanent rename of the previous `.resources/` convention.

## Canonical structure

`.shared/` follows the same spec-compliant directory structure used elsewhere in the repository:

- `.shared/scripts/`
- `.shared/assets/`
- `.shared/references/`
