# Summary

- **1) Categorize Everything**:
  - Deterministic → `scripts/` (repeatable automation, CLI tools, hashes, indexing)
  - Static → `assets/` (stable schemas, templates, controlled vocabularies)
  - Subjective → `references/` (agent instructions, heuristics, edge cases)

- **2) Control Rot**:
  - Prefer generated truth
  - Make drift visible
  - Separate identity from description
  - Maintain tight taxonomy

- **3) Subjective vs Deterministic**:
  - Deterministic if derivable from disk, rules, transforms, queries, formatters
  - Subjective if prioritization, risk assessment, tradeoffs, project context

- **4) Standard Skeleton**:
  1. Define artifacts
  2. Skill CLI interface
  3. Static schemas
  4. Reference guidance
  5. Rot controls
  6. Stable IDs

- **5) Kickoff Questions**:
  - What must be true?
  - What can be computed?
  - Where will drift happen?
  - What needs stable identity?
  - What needs judgment?
  - What must remain stable?

- **6) Working Definition**:
  - Deterministic = provable reruns
  - Static = rarely changed/reused
  - Subjective = requires explicit judgment
