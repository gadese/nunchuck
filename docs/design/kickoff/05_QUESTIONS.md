# Step 5: Use these questions every time

* What **must** be true, always? (invariants → scripts)
* What can be **computed** instead of documented? (generate it)
* Where will drift happen? (add validate/status)
* What needs stable identity? (hashes/IDs)
* What needs human judgment? (references)
* What must remain stable across versions? (assets)
