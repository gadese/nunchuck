# 3) Decide What Must Be Subjective vs Deterministic

Use this checklist:

## Should be deterministic if it is…

* [ ] derivable from disk state
* [ ] a rule/invariant
* [ ] a transform (input → output)
* [ ] a query (search/filter/list)
* [ ] a formatter

### Should be subjective if it is…

* [ ] a prioritization decision
* [ ] a risk assessment
* [ ] a tradeoff between competing goods
* [ ] something requiring project context or taste
