# 05_PROCEDURE.md — The canonical execution path

**Purpose**:

* Define *how* the skill is executed, step by step
* Serve as the default path unless explicitly overridden

**Contains**:

* Ordered steps
* Expected inputs / outputs
* Checkpoints or validation moments
* References to scripts where applicable

**Constraints**:

* Linear flow
* Minimal branching (prefer references to other docs if needed)
* No policy discussion

> This is where determinism lives.
