# Artifacts as Completion Signals
* Artifacts are declared at the **skill level**
* Validation checks artifact existence
* References may declare which artifacts they are responsible for producing
* Missing required artifacts → redirect to the producing reference(s)
This enables:
* mechanical “not done yet” detection
* precise recovery paths
* repeatable outcomes
