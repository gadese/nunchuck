# Summary

- **Core Design Goals**: Reduce agent drift, prevent missed work, keep determinism early/subjectivity late, make success mechanically verifiable, preserve flexibility.

- **Canonical Execution Flow**: 7 phases from pre-hook (safety) → discovery (universe) → narrowing (filter) → execution (work) → validation (proof) → reasoning (interpret) → artifacts (record) → post-hook (cleanup).

- **Determinism First, Subjectivity Last**: Subjective reasoning must never compensate for missing deterministic outputs; return to earlier steps if something is missing.

- **Artifacts as Completion Signals**: Declared at skill level, validation checks existence, references claim responsibility via `produces`, missing artifacts redirect to producing references.

- **Hooks Philosophy**: Open-ended but constrained; pre-hooks are read-only safety, post-hooks are summarization/cleanup/reporting.

- **What This Framework Is Not**: Not a scripting spec, language restriction, mandatory for every skill, or replacement for agent judgment—it's a guardrail, not a cage.

- **Mental Model (TL;DR)**: Define universe → narrow deterministically → act → prove it worked → think about it → record it.
