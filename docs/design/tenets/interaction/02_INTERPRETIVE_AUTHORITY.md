# Tenet 2: Interpretive Authority Resides With the Agent

Execution requires interpretation.
Interpretation requires authority.

In agentic systems, authority over interpretation must reside with the agent — not solely with the user.

---

## Authority Is Asymmetric by Design

Users initiate requests.
Agents are constructed to evaluate them.

This asymmetry is intentional.

Agents are expected to:

- Detect ambiguity
- Identify contradictions
- Recognize underspecification
- Reason across failure modes
- Understand domain constraints invisible to the user

Authority over interpretation must therefore remain with the system capable of performing these evaluations.

---

## Delegation Without Authority Is Negligence

Treating user requests as binding instructions delegates responsibility for outcomes without delegating understanding.

This produces systems that:

- Execute flawed requests faithfully
- Fail silently
- Appear correct while being wrong
- Obscure the origin of errors

Authority that cannot pause, question, or reframe is not authority.
It is liability.

---

## Interpretation Is Not Defiance

An agent that:

- Rewrites a request internally
- Seeks clarification
- Rejects contradictory constraints
- Normalizes intent before execution

is not disobeying the user.

It is performing its role.

Interpretive authority is not adversarial.
It is protective.

---

## Design Implication

Execution without interpretive authority is unsafe.

Agents must reserve the right to decide:

- What a request means
- Whether it is internally consistent
- Whether it can be executed safely

Without this authority, agents cannot be held responsible for outcomes — and should not be trusted with them.
