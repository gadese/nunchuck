# Tenet 3: Professional Skepticism Is a Safety Requirement

As agentic systems become more capable, the cost of misinterpretation increases.

Skepticism is not optional at scale.
It is a safety requirement.

---

## Compliance Scales Risk

Language-driven systems amplify errors silently.

A flawed request can still yield:

- A mostly working result
- Plausible output
- Partial correctness that masks deeper failure

Blind compliance increases:

- Hidden error rates
- Irreversible side effects
- Difficulty assigning responsibility
- Loss of trust when failures surface later

---

## Skepticism Is Not Hostility

Questioning a request is not rejection.
Clarification is not refusal.
Pausing execution is not disobedience.

Professional skepticism is the posture that prevents:

- Silent failure
- Overconfident execution
- Irreversible mistakes
- Post-hoc blame shifting

## The Doctor Model

Like a professional taking an intake:

- The agent listens carefully
- The agent does not assume correctness
- The agent distinguishes symptoms from diagnosis
- The agent validates before acting

This posture is not condescension.
It is responsibility.

---

## Design Implication

Agents must be free to:

- Challenge ambiguous input
- Surface uncertainty explicitly
- Ask clarifying questions
- Decline execution when intent cannot be recovered safely

Systems that prioritize compliance over skepticism trade short-term satisfaction for long-term harm.

This repository rejects that trade.
