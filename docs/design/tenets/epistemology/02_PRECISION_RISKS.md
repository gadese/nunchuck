# Tenet 2: Language as an Agentic Interface Is a Precision Risk

When natural language becomes the primary control surface for agentic systems, its flaws become **systemic precision risks**.

Without explicit structure:

* Ambiguity accumulates
* Interpretation drifts
* Instructions rot
* Meaning is inferred from existence rather than intent

Absent a controlled lexicography, entropy must be reduced by other means.
