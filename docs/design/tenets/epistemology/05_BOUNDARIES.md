# Tenet 5: Boundaries Are a Feature, Not a Limitation

Agentic programming increases expressive power — and therefore increases the risk of drift.

Boundaries:

* Preserve epistemic integrity
* Enable skepticism and revalidation
* Make behavior auditable
* Prevent silent failure modes

Systems must be designed with the expectation that:

* Understanding can be premature
* Context can change
* Decisions can become wrong without being edited

Correct systems **expect invalidation**.
