# Epistemic Tenets for Agent Skills Design

## Purpose

These tenets define the **epistemic foundations** of this repository.

They explain how agentic systems preserve:

- Truth
- Precision
- Reliability
- Determinism
- Auditability

They exist to justify why this repository imposes strong structure, explicit schemas, bounded execution, and deterministic compensation mechanisms.

These tenets are **not implementation rules**.  
They are **not APIs**.  
They are **not behavioral instructions**.  

They explain *why* such rules are necessary.

---

## Scope

Epistemic tenets govern:

- The limits of natural language
- The risks of language as a control surface
- The necessity of deterministic compensation
- The separation of qualitative judgment from quantitative truth
- The role of boundaries in preventing silent failure

They are **user-agnostic**.

Whether an agent is interacting with a novice, an expert, or another system, these constraints apply equally.

---

## Design Position

1. Natural language is inherently ambiguous.
2. Agentic systems amplify that ambiguity.
3. Precision cannot be negotiated into existence through better prompts.

Because language will fail, systems must be designed to succeed *despite* it.

---

## Summary Maxim

> **Language is for intent, Determinism is for truth.**

These tenets establish the epistemic ground on which all agent skills in this repository are built.
