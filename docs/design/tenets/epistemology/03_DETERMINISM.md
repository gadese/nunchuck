# Tenet 3: Deterministic Compensation Is Mandatory

Because language cannot be made precise, **precision must be recovered elsewhere**.

This recovery is achieved through **selective deterministic compensation**:

* Canonical schemas
* Explicit state machines
* Hashing and invariants
* Instrumentation over inference
* Automation over interpretation
* Structure over prose

Determinism does not replace language.
It **bounds** it.
