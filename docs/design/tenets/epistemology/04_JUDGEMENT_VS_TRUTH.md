## Tenet 4: Qualitative Judgment and Quantitative Truth Are Different

Human and agent reasoning excels at:

* Meaning
* Intent
* Interpretation
* Judgment

Systems excel at:

* Measurement
* Invariants
* Reproducibility
* Enforcement

Conflating these responsibilities produces brittle systems.

Effective agentic systems **separate qualitative judgment from quantitative truth**, then explicitly assign ownership of each.
