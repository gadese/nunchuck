# Nunchuck

A rigorously structured collection of agent skills designed to reduce drift, enforce determinism, and make agentic work auditable. Built on the [Open Agent-Skill Specification](https://github.com/JordanGunn/agent-skill-spec) and extended with internal specifications that define canonical structures, execution patterns, and epistemic guardrails.

## Design Philosophy

This repository treats language as inherently ambiguous and builds systems that succeed *despite* that ambiguity. Three principles guide all skill design:

- **Determinism First, Subjectivity Last** — Subjective reasoning must never compensate for missing deterministic outputs. If evidence is incomplete, return to earlier execution phases rather than explaining around gaps.

- **Artifacts as Completion Signals** — Success is mechanically verifiable. Skills declare what they produce; validation checks existence. Missing artifacts redirect execution to producing steps.

- **Professional Skepticism** — Agents interpret, clarify, and challenge rather than blindly comply. User input is valuable but not authoritative truth. Responsibility for correctness cannot be outsourced.

These principles are formalized in the [Design Documentation](./docs/design/.INDEX.md), which includes epistemic tenets, interaction tenets, and a determinism framework.

## Specification Compliance

### Open Agent-Skill Spec

All skills conform to the [Open Agent-Skill Specification](https://github.com/JordanGunn/agent-skill-spec), ensuring portability across agent platforms. Each `SKILL.md` contains frontmatter-only definitions with explicit metadata for references, scripts, and keywords.

### Internal Specifications

Beyond the open spec, this repository enforces internal specifications that define:

- **[SKILL.md Structure](./docs/design/specs/skillmd/.INDEX.md)** — Frontmatter schema, body constraints, validation rules
- **[References Structure](./docs/design/specs/references/.INDEX.md)** — Canonical 7-file reference set (`00_ROUTER` through `06_FAILURES`)
- **[Scripts Structure](./docs/design/specs/scripts/.INDEX.md)** — Cross-platform script requirements and naming

These specifications ensure consistency across all skills and enable tooling to validate compliance.

## Skills

All skills live in the `skills/` directory. Browse them directly or use the reference documentation:

- **[Skills Reference](./docs/SKILLS.md)** — Complete list of skills with descriptions and keywords

## Usage

See the **[Quickstart Guide](./docs/QUICKSTART.md)** for installation, IDE integration, and first steps.

---

## Scripts

Utility scripts provide thin integration layers without duplicating skill content. Skills remain spec-compliant so they transfer cleanly when IDEs adopt agent skills natively.

### IDE Adapters

Generate IDE-specific configurations that reference skills without copying them:

```bash
# Windsurf: generates .windsurf/workflows/
bash scripts/adapters/windsurf/run.sh --skills-root skills --output-root .

# Cursor: generates .cursor/commands/
bash scripts/adapters/cursor/run.sh --skills-root skills --output-root .
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\scripts\adapters\windsurf\run.ps1 --skills-root skills --output-root .
.\scripts\adapters\cursor\run.ps1 --skills-root skills --output-root .
```
